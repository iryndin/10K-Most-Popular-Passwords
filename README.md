# 10K-Most-Popular-Passwords

It is well known that users tend to use simple passwords while registration in any site or web service. But this is of great danger because lists of common passwords are well known to hacker community and are used actively. 

So, it is of great respect for any site/webservice to check passwords for presence in these lists and to warn user about this and do not allow to register (sign up) with such (compromised!) password. If your website doesn't have a captcha on login form it takes only few seconds to test all 10K most popular passwords and find out that used by the user of your site. 

If you are an ethical hacker, or penetration tester, you can clone this repo and use the .txt file against programs such as John the Ripper or Aircrack-ng however this should only be completed if you have permisson to test the network. Please note often Wifi networks will not follow the same password naming convention as traditional user passwords, unless the network has had the wireless key changed since installation. 

So, be aware! Please use this list of 10K most popular passwords while user sign up and don't allow users to use these compromised passwords!

The list of passwords is taken from Discourse Repo: http://github.com/discourse
